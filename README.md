**Note**: 

The current version of the ptenum plugin can be found here: [https://github.com/f-block/volatility-plugins](https://github.com/f-block/volatility-plugins). It has been updated intensely and ported to Volatility3.

For the last (but now outdated) Rekall version see here: [https://github.com/f-block/rekall-plugins](https://github.com/f-block/rekall-plugins).

Branch `updates` contains some updates and instructions for the used tools, so they can be built easily with MinGW. Any changes are solely done in the branch `updates`. The branch `main` is at the same state as of writing the paper to allow a unaltered reproducability of our results.

This is the online repository for the paper "Windows Memory Forensics: Detecting (un)intentionally hidden injected Code by examining Page Table Entries" by Frank Block and Andreas Dewald (https://dfrws.org/presentation/windows-memory-forensics-detecting-unintentionally-hidden-injected-code-by-examining-page-table-entries/).
It contains all material referenced in the paper, including the resulting Rekall plugin: ptenum.py
